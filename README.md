# **MovieZone: A Customized Movie Recommendation Platform**

## **Project Description**

This project is a full-stack project web app movie recommendation system with functionalities including registration, authentication, movie searches by keywords, display of trending movies, and recommendations based on user preferences.

The free tier version of AWS EC2 doesn't have enough space for a collaborate-filtering model of this size. You can try to use your own device as a server to provide the model API.
